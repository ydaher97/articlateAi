# Language Articulation App

A Next.js application that helps users improve their language articulation through focused writing exercises. The app provides daily software engineering topics and uses AI to grade submissions based on clarity, coherence, and conciseness.

## Features

- 🔐 **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Firebase
- 📝 **Daily Writing Exercises**: Unique software engineering topics generated by AI
- 📊 **Word Count Challenges**: Strict 100-word and 50-word summary requirements
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Grading**: Automated feedback on clarity, coherence, and conciseness
- 📈 **Progress Tracking**: Analytics dashboard showing improvement over time
- 🎯 **Streak System**: Track consecutive days of participation

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui

## AI Grading Criteria

The AI evaluates submissions based on three key metrics:

1. **Clarity** (1-10): How well the concepts are explained
2. **Coherence** (1-10): How logically the ideas flow
3. **Conciseness** (1-10): How effectively the word limit is used
